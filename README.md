# Strongly Connected Component (SCC) of Graphs
A recursive Deep-First Search (DFS) algorithm is used. DFS is used to seach grpahs (find all reachable nodes from any nodes).

Each text file contains the edges of a directed graph. Vertices are labeled as positive integers from 1. Every row indicates an edge, the vertex label in first column is the tail and the vertex label in second column is the head (the graph is directed, and the edges are directed from the first column vertex to the second column vertex). The code reads these files and convert the obtained list to a "list represtantion" of the graph before performing DFS and DFS-LOOP functions.
